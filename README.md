# COVID19
This repository contains our experiments for IEEE Access paper. The paper is related to detecting cross cultural emotion and sentiment about COVID-19 pendemic. 
Our experiments start with collection of tweets related to COVID-19 hashtags. We developed LSTM based classifier for emotion and sentiment polarity classification. 
The modes used in both the classifiers are available on following links,
Classifier_B model for negative sentiments (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dbXncfKcSC5fUz5NkSbVmV4CgV2onnCl/view?usp=sharing)
Classifier_C model for positive sentiments (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dbXncfKcSC5fUz5NkSbVmV4CgV2onnCl/view?usp=sharing)
